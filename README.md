# GW-Campus-Dining-Finder
As part of ISTM 6205 (Web Application Development), my group has created a GW campus dining finder website by utilizing html, css, javascript.

This project solves an important user-side problem that many GW students are experiencing when finding dining options that provide discounts. 
Currently, the school's website only shows a list of the vendors, location, and different discount options. 

However, students have to search diners manually every time they have questions such as ‘Which place is closer to where I am at?’, ‘Is online order available for this restaurant?’, 'Which diner provides student discounts?'.
